## Research Question
"How does air quality in major cities correlate with economic indicators and public health outcomes?"

## Datasets to Support the Research
- [Air Quality Data:](https://aqicn.org/api/) The World Air Quality Index project provides real-time air quality data for cities worldwide.
- [Economic Indicators:](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/home) The World Bank offers a comprehensive dataset on various economic indicators by country, including GDP, unemployment rates, and industrial production indices.
- [Public Health Data:](https://data.who.int/countries/840)Public Health Data: The World Health Organization provides datasets on various health indicators, including respiratory disease prevalence and mortality rates.
- [City-specific Data:](https://www.bea.gov/resources/for-developers) Many cities publish their own open data portals with detailed local information on air quality, economic factors, and health statistics.

## Potential Analyses
- Time Series Analysis: Examine how air quality changes over time in relation to economic growth or decline.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigate the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory disease rates.
- Comparative Analysis: Compare air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes across different cities or regions.
- Predictive Modeling: Use economic indicators to predict future air quality trends.


## Visualizations
- Line graphs showing trends in air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes over time.
- Scatter plots demonstrating correlations between air pollution levels and economic or health variables.
- Bar charts comparing economic and health indicators across cities with different air quality levels.
- Interactive dashboards allowing users to explore relationships between different variables.
