## DataSet
States: NY, WA, NM
Timeframe: 2015 ~ 2020

## Research Question
"What is the correlation between respiratory disease and air quality across the US? Is there any?"

### Secondary Focuses
- Explore trends in air quality changes over time across different states.

### Analyses
1. - **Descriptive analysis**: We want to summarize the data and communicate to the audience that statistics of each dataset.
    - We will compare AQI in different locations and provide their population counts for the years we are presenting.
    - We will acknowledge this is broad and that there are other factors but we are looking for overarching trends that can be applied across the US.
2. - **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between AQI and POD in a given area
    - Scatter plots demonstrating correlations between air pollution levels and health variables.
    - We will create visualizations of the data for each area and each sex affected by the AQI. Thats 3 data visualizations for state we are looking at. (e.g. Men, Women, both)
3. - **Comparative Analysis**: Compare air quality and health outcomes across different cities or regions.
    - Bar charts comparing health indicators across cities with different air quality levels.
    - We can also overlap our previous data visualizations so that we can compare each area to eachother and note large differences

### Datasets to Support the Research
- [AirNowAPI : Air Quality Index](https://docs.airnowapi.org/) The World Air Quality Index project provides real-time air quality data for cities worldwide.

- [World Health Organization : Public Health Data](https://data.who.int/countries/840)Public Health Data: The World Health Organization provides datasets on various health indicators, including respiratory disease prevalence and mortality rates.
