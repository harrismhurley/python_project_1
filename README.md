## Research Question
"What is the correlation between air quality in major cities and public health outcomes across the US? How do economic indicators factor into these trends?"

### Secondary Focuses
- Investigate how air quality in major cities correlates with respiratory diseases and economic indicators.
- Explore trends in air quality changes over time across different states.

### Dataset
- **States Analyzed**: NY, WA, NM
- **Timeframe**: 2015â€“2020

### Analyses
1. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Examine how air quality changes over time in relation to economic growth or decline.
   - Visualize trends using line graphs showing air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes over time.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Investigate the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory disease rates.
   - Use scatter plots to demonstrate correlations between air pollution levels and economic/health variables.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Compare air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes across different cities or regions.
   - Use bar charts and overlapping visualizations to highlight differences and trends.

4. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Summarize data to highlight trends in air quality and population counts for the years analyzed.
   - Include visualizations for gender-based health outcomes (e.g., male, female, combined).

5. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Use economic indicators to predict future air quality trends.

### Visualizations
- Line graphs showing trends in air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes over time.
- Scatter plots demonstrating correlations between air pollution levels and health variables.
- Bar charts comparing health indicators across cities with different air quality levels.
- Overlapping visualizations to compare trends across regions.
