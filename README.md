## Research Question
"How does air quality in major cities correlate with economic indicators and public health outcomes?"

### Analyses
- Time Series Analysis: Examine how air quality changes over time in relation to economic growth or decline.
    - Line graphs showing trends in air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes over time.

- Correlation Analysis: Investigate the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory disease rates.
    - Scatter plots demonstrating correlations between air pollution levels and economic or health variables.

- Comparative Analysis: Compare air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes across different cities or regions.
    - Bar charts comparing economic and health indicators across cities with different air quality levels.
