## Research Question
"What is the correlation between respiratory disease and air quality across the US? Is there any?"

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Secondary Focuses

### Datasets to Support the Research
- [Air Quality Data:](https://aqicn.org/api/) The World Air Quality Index project provides real-time air quality data for cities worldwide.
- [Economic Indicators:](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/home) The World Bank offers a comprehensive dataset on various economic indicators by country, including GDP, unemployment rates, and industrial production indices.
- [Public Health Data:](https://data.who.int/countries/840)Public Health Data: The World Health Organization provides datasets on various health indicators, including respiratory disease prevalence and mortality rates.
- [City-specific Data:](https://www.bea.gov/resources/for-developers) Many cities publish their own open data portals with detailed local information on air quality, economic factors, and health statistics.

### Potential Analyses
- Time Series Analysis: Examine how air quality changes over time in relation to economic growth or decline.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigate the relationship between air pollution levels and respiratory disease rates.
- Comparative Analysis: Compare air quality, economic indicators, and health outcomes across different cities or regions.
- Predictive Modeling: Use economic indicators to predict future air quality trends.

### Analyses
- Descriptive analysis: We want to summarize the data and communicate to the audience that statistics of each dataset.
    - We will compare AQI in different locations and provide their population counts for the years we are presenting.
    - We will acknowledge this is broad and that there are other factors but we are looking for overarching trends that can be applied across the US.

- Correlation Analysis: Investigate the relationship between AQI and POD in a given area
    - Scatter plots demonstrating correlations between air pollution levels and health variables.
    - We will create visualizations of the data for each area and each sex affected by the AQI. Thats 3 data visualizations for state we are looking at. (e.g. Men, Women, both)

- Comparative Analysis: Compare air quality and health outcomes across different cities or regions.
    - Bar charts comparing health indicators across cities with different air quality levels.
    - We can also overlap our previous data visualizations so that we can compare each area to eachother and note large differences
